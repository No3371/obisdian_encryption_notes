# Double Ratchet Algorithm
In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), the **Double Ratchet Algorithm** (previously referred to as the **Axolotl Ratchet**[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm#cite_note-Perrin-2016-03-30-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm#cite_note-signal-inside-and-out-2)) is a [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography) "Key (cryptography)") management algorithm that was developed by [Trevor Perrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trevor_Perrin&action=edit&redlink=1 "Trevor Perrin (page does not exist)") and [Moxie Marlinspike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike "Moxie Marlinspike") in 2013. It can be used as part of a [cryptographic protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol "Cryptographic protocol") to provide [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption "End-to-end encryption") for [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging "Instant messaging"). After an initial [key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-agreement_protocol "Key-agreement protocol") it manages the ongoing renewal and maintenance of short-lived session keys. It combines a cryptographic so-called "ratchet" based on the [[Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange]](DH) and a ratchet based on a [key derivation function](Key%20Derivation%20Function) (KDF), such as a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash function"), and is therefore called a double ratchet.

The algorithm is considered self-healing because under certain conditions it prevents an attacker from accessing the cleartext of future messages after having compromised one of the user's keys.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm#cite_note-advanced-ratcheting-3) New session keys are exchanged after a few rounds of communication. This effectively forces the attacker to [intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack "Man-in-the-middle attack") _all_ communication between the honest parties, since they lose access as soon as a key exchange occurs that is not intercepted. This property was later named _Future Secrecy_, or _Post-Compromise Security_.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm#cite_note-4)

## Etymology


![A gif of a ratchet moving showing that the mechanism can only move in one direction](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Ratchet_example.gif/125px-Ratchet_example.gif)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ratchet_example.gif)
A mechanical ratchet

"[Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl "Axolotl")" was in reference to the salamander's self-healing properties. The term "ratchet" in cryptography is used in analogy to a [mechanical ratchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_(device) "Ratchet (device)"). In the mechanical sense, a ratchet only allows advancement in one direction; a cryptographic ratchet only allows keys to be generated from the previous key. Unlike a mechanical ratchet, however, **each state is unique**.
